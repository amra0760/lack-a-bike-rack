            <p class="text-faded mb-4"> Bicycle parking still remains an issue despite the fact that bicycles have been around for centuries. However, civilians and cyclists are not the ones to blame, lack of secure on-street bicycle parking is though.</p><br>
            <p class="text-faded mb-4">This issue is more important than it seems since when consumers can not find somewhere safe to place their bikes, they tend to rely on other methods to leave their bikes unsafely attached to any type of standing surface. This will most likely be a tree, a parking post, mailbox or some other type of lighting post or even at times a fire hydrant. This not only is a nuisance to other residents and commuters, but also hazardous, and for some objects like a tree is illegal, as there is a $1,000 dollar fine for parking a bike on a tree.</p></br>
            <p class="text-faded mb-4"> This website serves to inform and raise awareness about this issue, as well as preview locations of bike racks nearby the user’s destination. This hopefully will change the minds of commuters to possibly lead them to advocate for this issue as well possibly including cycling in their daily methods of commuting.</p>

            A long time advocate and unfortunately a very experienced journalist of the results of this issue is New York-based filmmaker: Casey Neistat. Throughout his past Mr. Neistat has had several of his bikes stolen due to lack of secure bike racks and so he
            resulted in advocating for this issue by posting several videos which have all went viral and made a statement. His first video was posted in 2005 after years of having countless bikes and bike parts stolen. Seeing that this was a chronic
            issue, he decided to test the system just to see how easy it was to steal a bike. Watch this video at 'Bike Thief High Resolution'

          <p>In 2012, Neistat decided to conduct another self-experiment again to see how easy it would be to steal a bike, since he still had numerous bikes being stolen from him. In this test he was purposely looking extra suspicious and trying to get
            attention so someone, especially a cop, would stop him. Having had three bikes successfully ‘stolen’ and more than 50 witnesses walking past him, (having even stole one in front of a precinct!) a group of policemen finally came to stop him.
            When he questioned them to see how many bike thieves have they have caught in their careers, they all responded with zero (Bike Theft, 2012). Watch this video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGttmR2DTY8">'Bike Thief 2012'</a>.

          <p>The following year, in 2013, Casey even went on to install a bike rack of his own! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90KSuqp2Ssk">'Stolen Bike in NYC'</a>
